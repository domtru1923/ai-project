Building AI course project
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

For business purposes, it is important to have good descriptions of your products. If you have a lot of products and various customers it can be difficult and time consuming to prepare suitable descriptions to your website. This solution will be a fast and modern alternative to copywriters.

## Background

My idea is designed for the online sellers of any products and services. It can solve a huge challenge on how to attract customer and provide him with useful information. This problem is almost everywhere because the percentage of online selling is rapidly increasing. I am interested in this topic for the last 7 years. I was a copywriter and I think that AI is a good way how to solve the problem of making suitable descriptions for various groups of customers in a short time.

## How is it used?

The "AI Copywriter" should be user-friendly. A user will put the product data into the model. He will also choose variables like length of the text, group of people or style of communication. The output will be the description with all the inserted information and suitable for the certain target group.

## Data sources and AI methods

Of course, we will need a lot of training data. We can use existing solutions like those mentioned in the part "Deep learning" of the "Building AI" course. Our model can train itself also with existing descriptions written by regular copywriters. I also think about dictionaries as sources of data. The model can learn relationships and similarities between words. The quality of the data will be crucial. It is important to use grammatically correct training data in order to have the model with good knowledge of grammar rules. Customers are also affected by this aspect of text - its overall appearance. The description has to look good, grammatically correct and attractive. If it meets these requirements, customers' buying decision can be significantly affected.

## Challenges

I see limitations mainly in using this solution for various languages. Many sellers have websites for domestic and international customers, so our solution needs to be prepared for using more than one language.

## What next?

For me as a non-programmer, the biggest challenge is to gain skills in the area of coding and find smart people to move the idea on.
